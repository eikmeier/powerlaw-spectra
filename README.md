Revisiting power-laws distributions in spectra of real world networks
==================

* Nicole Eikmeier and David F. Gleich

These programs generate and reproduce the key figures from our KDD2017 paper 

> Nicole Eikmeier and David F. Gleich. Revisiting power-laws distributions
> in spectra of real world networks. KDD, 2017.

The main file of all the data is `Matrix_Info`, a csv file that is
read by the various Jupyter notebooks.
